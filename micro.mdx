## What?

React introduced a concept called Component-Based-Architecture, a method for encapsulating individual pieces of a larger user interface (aka components) into self-sustaining, independent micro-systems

</Split>

### Component

You can think of a component as a small feature that makes up a piece of the user interface.

</Split>

<Notes>

- If I were to describe a component within the scope of Facebook’s UI, A chat window would be a component, a comment feed would be another component, and a constantly updating friend list would represent yet another component.
- Each of these components exist within the same space, yet interact independently from one another.
- Components have their own structure, their own methods and their own APIs.
- Components are also reusable and can be “pasted” into interfaces at will.
- The independent nature of components allows for developers to create a UI with many different moving parts.

</Notes>

---

## Why?

---

### Components are independent

<Notes>

- Components build off of the concept of AJAX requests, in which calls to the server are made directly from the client-side
- allowing for the DOM to be dynamically updated without the need of a page refresh
- each have their own interfaces that can make calls to the server and update their interfaces
- one component can refresh without affecting other components or the UI as a whole

</Notes>

---

### Components can improve performance

<Notes>

- React.js handles components in an extremely performant way.
- React.js uses something called a virtual DOM which uses a “diffing” algorithm to detect changes to a component and only render those changes, as opposed to re-rendering the entire component.

</Notes>

---

### Component is comprised of a JS class 

<Notes>

- requires that all methods and APIs pertaining to a single component exist within that component’s structure.
- Whereas MVC separates structure, helper methods, and routing into different levels of the application, components contain all of those features within a single class
- Developers don’t have to spend much time trying to find which functions pertain to which parts of an application’s UI.
- I personally prefer to structure files based on it category (routes, container, component, redux) with their name inherit from the functionality or module.

</Notes>

---

### Components are reusable

<Notes>

- major selling point for applications that reuse features, but still want different copies of those features to act independently.

> _"We’re not designing pages, we’re designing systems of components."_

-- Stephen Hay

<Notes>

- For the most part, we're working with web pages and screens in mobile app.
- We might see it as working on a whole page but we might not realize that consciously, we're working with a numbers of component.
- We are working on this atomic component, that build into a larger and complex component.

</Notes>

---

> _"Similarly, interfaces are made up of smaller components. This means we can break entire interfaces down into fundamental building blocks and work up from there. That’s the basic gist of atomic design."_

-- Brad Frost

<Notes>

- Brad in his article, coin the terms "Atomic Design", which discuss on the matter of breaking your design, page or screen into atomic representation.

</Notes>

---

Atoms > Molecules > Organisms > Templates > Pages

<Notes>

- The atomic design are breaks into 5 elements, which in the represent the whole webpage.
- This levels are crucial in that it would help developers and designers to achieve a much more comprehensive design-system with a well defined purpose.

</Notes>

---

## How?

<Notes>

- In designing components' and its API, there're a numbers of things that need to be consider, and pattern that can be adopt.

</Notes>

---

### Aim for a small API surface area

React library itself aims for a Minimal API Surface Area

<Notes>

- The fewer new things you need to learn, the easier it is for others to know how to use the components that you create, making them more reusable.
- If someone doesn’t understand your component API, the chance that they’ll duplicate your work increases. 
- This idea should be the core of how you should approach creating components, and you will find it helpful to keep in mind as you work.

</Notes>

---

### Make it easy to find

<Notes>

- Start with a flat directory structure and don’t prematurely organize your code base. 
- Humans love to organize things, but we’re also really terrible at it. 
- Naming things is hard enough, and by creating a directory structure around your component library, you might end up doing more work that makes it more difficult for others to find the things you’ve done.
- A single directory of components can get quite large before it becomes difficult for people to manage. 
- And if all the components are in a single folder, you’ll get alphabetical ordering for free in most file-system tools, which can help provide a more complete picture of the code base for others.

</Notes>

---

### Avoid `render*` function

>_"[It] effectively means there’s enough complexity to be worth breaking down"_

-- Chris Biscardi
<Notes>

- If you’ve defined a custom method in your component that starts with the word render, chances are that should be its own component. 
- React’s smart about when to render or not render a component, so by splitting these out into their own components, you can help React do its job better.

</Notes>

#### Don't

```jsx
class List extends Component {
  
  renderItem = (items) => items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.label}</li>)

  render() {
    return (<ul>
      {this.renderItem(this.props.items)}
    </ul>)
  }
}
```

---

#### Do

```jsx
const Item = item => (<li>{item}</li>)
const Items = items => items.map(item => <Item key={item.id} item={item.label} />)

class List extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ul><Items items={this.props.items} /></ul>
    )
  }
}
```

<Notes>

- Let say, we need a way to track on the selected item.
- This way, you can extend the items component to hold its own state of selected item, so that when that state change the Items will rerender, but not the whole List component.

</Notes>
