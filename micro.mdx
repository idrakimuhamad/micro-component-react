## What?

React introduced a concept called Component-Based-Architecture, a method for encapsulating individual pieces of a larger user interface (aka components) into self-sustaining, independent micro-systems

---

### Component

You can think of a component as a small feature that makes up a piece of the user interface.

<Notes>

- If I were to describe a component within the scope of Facebook’s UI, A chat window would be a component, a comment feed would be another component, and a constantly updating friend list would represent yet another component.
- Each of these components exist within the same space, yet interact independently from one another. 
- Components have their own structure, their own methods and their own APIs. 
- Components are also reusable and can be “pasted” into interfaces at will. 
- The independent nature of components allows for developers to create a UI with many different moving parts.
